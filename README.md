# Visa Fraud Detection (Machine Learning Model Evaluation Project)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating several machine learning models to predict outcomes based on a dataset. The models implemented include:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of each model using accuracy metrics and determine the best model based on the dataset.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array management.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides machine learning algorithms and tools such as:
  - `train_test_split`: For splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.
  - `KNeighborsClassifier`: For building the KNN classifier.
  - `LinearRegression`: For implementing the linear regression model.
  - `DecisionTreeClassifier`: For building the decision tree model.
  - `RandomForestClassifier`: For implementing the random forest classifier.
- **Graphviz**: Visualization of decision tree models.
  
## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn graphviz
